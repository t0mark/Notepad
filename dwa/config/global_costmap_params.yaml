# ============================================================

global_costmap:
  # ===== Frame Configuration =====

  # The global frame for the costmap to operate in
  # For global costmap, typically 'map' frame
  global_frame: map

  # The name of the frame for the base link of the robot
  robot_base_frame: base_link

  # ===== Update and Publish Frequency =====

  # How often to update the costmap (Hz)
  # Lower frequency than local costmap since global planning is slower
  update_frequency: 1.0

  # How often to publish visualization info (Hz)
  # Set to 0.0 to disable publishing (saves bandwidth)
  publish_frequency: 0.5

  # ===== Map Configuration =====

  # Whether to use a static map (from map_server)
  # For global costmap with SLAM: false (builds map dynamically)
  # For global costmap with pre-built map: true
  static_map: false

  # Whether the costmap should roll with the robot
  # true: costmap moves with robot (for large environments without static map)
  # false: costmap is fixed to the map frame
  rolling_window: true

  # Width of the costmap (meters)
  # Larger than local costmap for long-range planning
  width: 50.0

  # Height of the costmap (meters)
  height: 50.0

  # Resolution of the costmap (meters/cell)
  # Can be coarser than local costmap for efficiency
  resolution: 0.1

  # Origin of the costmap in the global frame
  # For rolling window or static map, typically handled automatically
  # origin_x: 0.0
  # origin_y: 0.0

  # ===== Transform Tolerance =====

  # Maximum allowable transform age (seconds)
  # Overrides the common parameter if specified
  transform_tolerance: 0.5

  # ===== Footprint =====

  # Additional padding for the footprint in global costmap (meters)
  # Provides extra safety margin for global planning
  footprint_padding: 0.02

  # ===== Layer Plugins =====
  # Uncomment to explicitly define costmap layers

  # For static map with obstacles:
  # plugins:
  #   - {name: static_layer,        type: "costmap_2d::StaticLayer"}
  #   - {name: obstacle_layer,      type: "costmap_2d::VoxelLayer"}
  #   - {name: inflation_layer,     type: "costmap_2d::InflationLayer"}

  # For dynamic mapping (SLAM):
  # plugins:
  #   - {name: obstacle_layer,      type: "costmap_2d::VoxelLayer"}
  #   - {name: inflation_layer,     type: "costmap_2d::InflationLayer"}

  # ===== Additional Parameters =====

  # Whether to always send full costmap updates
  # always_send_full_costmap: false

  # Track unknown space
  # track_unknown_space: true

  # Use maximum value for unknown space when combining layers
  # unknown_cost_value: 255

  # Whether to publish the voxel grid for visualization
  # publish_voxel_map: false
